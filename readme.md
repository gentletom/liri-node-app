Liri-Bot

Homework for Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech using Node.js and Javascript.

The bot takes in 4 different commands:

1. "my-tweets"   (will fetch my last 20 tweets)
2. "spotify-this-song"     (takes a song title and returns relevant information)
3. "movie-this"     (takes a movie title and returns relevant information)
4. "do-what-it-says"      (will do one of the above 3 tasks and will read command input out into a test file)

This project is not completed. I was not sure how to pull up to date packages or how to utilize key pulls. Its pretty close to completion but needs more work. This was certainly one of the harder assignments so far and I'm at a loss with this one.
